EXPLORING IN THE WORLD
AN EXCITING MOVE
ALL THE PORTS ARE GREAT

NOW YOU REALIZE (WHAT YOU ARE)
SOME QUESTIONS IN YOUR MIND (WITH YOUR HEART)
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND

THEN CHRISTMAS TIME WILL COME
FALL SEMESTER HAS GONE
0N THE LAST DAY ON AT SEA
FAREWELL TO ALL YOU SAY,
TEARS FALLING IN YOUR EYES
WATCHING ALL YOUR FRIENDS
KISSING YOU AND SAID GOOD BYE.
